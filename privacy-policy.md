# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the mobile game developed and published by Grad Team.

## 1. Data Collection

Our game uses third-party services, including:

- **Firebase (by Google)**: for cloud data storage, analytics, and crash reporting.
- **Google Play Games Services**: for authentication and saving progress.

These services may collect device information (e.g., device model, OS version) and anonymous usage data to improve performance and user experience.

We do **not** collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or location.

## 2. Authentication

If you choose to log in using **Google Play Games**, your basic profile (e.g., username and user ID) is managed by Google. We do not access or store this data outside the scope of Play Games Services.

## 3. Data Usage

Collected data is only used to:
- Track performance and fix bugs (via Firebase Crashlytics),
- Store in-game progress and achievements (via Firebase Firestore and Play Games),
- Improve the game experience.

We do **not** sell, share, or misuse your data.

## 4. Children

Our game is not directed to children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected data from a child, please contact us so we can remove it.
